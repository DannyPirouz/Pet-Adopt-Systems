# Pet Adopt Systems

Pet Adopt Systems is a database for a pet shelter adoption system. The database provides the functionality of storing all the animals' information, adding, and updating animals' information, and many unique features where a user can find useful statistics. For example, a user can find the youngest animals for each shelter which could be useful information for adopters wanting a young pet. Our database is designed to make it very easy and clear for management to understand what is going on at every step of the adoption process.
